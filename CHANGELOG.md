All notable changes to the Memcheck-Cover project will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased](https://github.com/Farigh/memcheck-cover/tree/HEAD)

[Full Changelog](https://github.com/Farigh/memcheck-cover/compare/release-1.1...HEAD)

**New features:**
  - Add support for Valgrind's `--fullpath-after` option to the `memcheck_runner.sh` script
  - Add support for path prefix substitution to the `generate_html_report.sh` script (issue [#15](https://github.com/Farigh/memcheck-cover/issues/15))
  - Add support for version control server link to the `generate_html_report.sh` script (issue [#16](https://github.com/Farigh/memcheck-cover/issues/16))

**Enhancements:**
  - Reduced the report header size
  - Improved the report dark themes (Process termination and host stacktrace titles are now more visible)
  - Reworked the report title selection to match the theme selection style

**Fixed bugs:**
  - Color reset sequence was not working properly in some environment (was set to `\e[00m` instead of `\e[0m`)
  - Fixed gawk newer version (5.0) raised warnings

## [v1.0](https://github.com/Farigh/memcheck-cover/releases/tag/release-1.0) (2020-05-08)

The initial version of the memcheck-cover tools.

The `memcheck_runner.sh` script supports the following options:
  - `-h|--help` which displays the help message.
  - `-i|--ignore=FILE` which provides FILE to Valgrind as the suppression file.
  - `-o|--output-name=NAME` which is mandatory and defines the output file name (which will be suffixed with the .memcheck extension).
  - `-s|--gen-suppressions` which enables Valgrind suppression generation in the output file, those can be used to create a suppression file.

---

The `generate_html_report.sh` script supports the following options:
  - `-h|--help` which displays this help message.
  - `-g|--generate-config` which generates a 'memcheck-cover.config' file in the current directory, containing the default configuration values.
  - `-c|--config=FILE` which loads the configuration from FILE. An example configuration file can be generated using the --generate-config option.\
If this option is not set, or values are missing in FILE, the default values will be used.
  - `-i|--input-dir=DIR` which is mandatory and defines the input directory where the .memcheck files are.\
The files will be searched in directories recursivly.
  - `-o|--output-dir=DIR` which is mandatory and defines the output directory where the HTML report will be produced.

The `generate_html_report.sh` script highlights the following elements:
  - SUMMARY headers
  - Sources file and line in stacktraces
  - Violation suppressions
  - LEAK SUMMARY elements from memcheck/mc_leakcheck.c:
    - definitely lost: .\* bytes in .\* blocks
    - indirectly lost: .\* bytes in .\* blocks
    - possibly lost: .\* bytes in .\* blocks
    - still reachable: .\* bytes in .\* blocks
    - of which reachable via heuristic:
  - Violations from memcheck/mc_errors.c:
