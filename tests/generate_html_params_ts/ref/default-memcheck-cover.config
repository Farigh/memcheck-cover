# Such checks are provided by valgrind's header <memcheck.h>
# (see: https://valgrind.org/docs/manual/mc-manual.html#mc-manual.clientreqs)

# LEAK SUMMARY section.
######

# Criticality for the following leak summary type: definitely lost: 4 bytes in 1 blocks
memcheck_summary_criticality['definitely_lost']="error"

# Criticality for the following leak summary type: indirectly lost: 4 bytes in 1 blocks

#===========================
#===  Advanced options   ===
#===========================

# Prefix replacement can be applied to remove or replace paths prefixes
# It can be defined by filling the following map:
#    memcheck_path_prefix_replacement["<prefix_to_replace>"]="<replacement_value>"
# Where the key 'prefix_to_replace' is the path's prefix to be replaced
# And the value 'replacement_value' is the replacing value (it can be left empty to remove the prefix completly)
#
# For example, setting:
#    memcheck_path_prefix_replacement["/var/user/repo"]="<repo>"
# Would convert the following report line:
#    ==1==    at 0x10101042: myFunc() (/var/user/repo/src/lib1/MyClass.cpp:14)
# To:
#    ==1==    at 0x10101042: myFunc() (<repo>/src/lib1/MyClass.cpp:14)
#
# Multiple replacements can be defined
